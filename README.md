# Project

This project for the final week of Using API's module. The project must contain an own single-page application that is connected to an API!
 To good use and build this project, we should use everythings we have learned in modules:
 
#### - HTML/CSS/GIT
#### - JAVASCRIPT
#### - BROWSERS
#### - USING API'S


# Backlog

This is quite a big undertaking, so during the project <b><em> Kelley van Evert </b></em>was be assigned as a mentor for the working.

## Must-Haves
